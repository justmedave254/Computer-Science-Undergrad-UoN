#What it Does
/*
Use the while loop to write a program that will print in reverse order the numbers preceding a 
given number starting with the given number and calculate the product of the numbers . 
For example if the given number is 5 the output should be 5,4,3,2,1.
The output should also indicate the product after each iteration.
