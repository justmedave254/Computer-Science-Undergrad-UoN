# Question One
/*
Create a program that will help the grade three students practice calculating the areas of the various shapes.
The program should have a menu where the student will select the shape they want to practice with. Once
the student selects a shape, the program should randomly select the parameters for calculating area of the
selected shape (Hint use rand function to generate random numbers) and ask the student for the answer.
The student answer should be checked to see if it is correct. If the student answer is correct, the student
should be a warded a point and new numbers for the parameters for calculating the area of the selected
shape are provided to the student. If the student answer is wrong the program should display the correct
answer and provide new numbers for the parameters for calculating the area of the selected shape. The
student should be provided with an option to continue practicing or quit after each attempt. If the student
selects to quit, the program should display the number of attempts and the total points earned.
